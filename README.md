# Iggys-Bizzare-Adventure

this game is using the phaser engine and built by html and javascript.

I chose this as my final project to show off what I was taught in class and to show off my love for video games by making one.

# How to run...

go to terminal, 
type in python -m SimpleHTTPServer,
then use this http://127.0.0.1:8000 to run the game,
or this http://192.168.1.2:8000 which ever works for you.
